# Swag and supplies

[WordCamp Central](https://central.wordcamp.org) will supply official lanyards when possible, and there are [solutions for office supplies](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/supplies/) you may need for your event. Otherwise, you can [print lanyards, buttons, and stickers locally](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/swag/swag-source-files/).

Swag is a different story: hardly an essential, swag is mostly a nice-to-have for attendees and speakers. Here’s how you can make it more sustainable:  

- Offer experiences and services rather than stuff: dinner with one of the speakers, an e-book written by another, a WordPress website, a pro-level license for a plugin, a hosting plan, time-limited premium services, or design consultation. 
- Encourage attendees to choose sustainable alternatives when they register for the event. List the available options in declining order:
    - Option to opt out of swag in favor of a social or environmental charity.
    - Option for "none"
    - Option for “lanyard”, with a suggestion to bring their own.  
    - Option for “swag”.
    - Option for “bottle/mug”.
    - Option for “t-shirt”.
- Prioritize sustainable swag items for speakers. Check out the [Inspiration section](https://make.wordpress.org/sustainability/handbook/sustainable-events/inspiration/) for ideas. 
- When printing swag items locally, consider a timeless design: **only** feature the WordPress logo. This ensures surplus swag could be used in other events. [Find links to WordPress's official designs in the WordCamp Organizer Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/swag/swag-source-files/).

Plan what to do with surplus swag after the event.

- Set up a dropoff point for lanyards. 
- When possible, coordinate with other WordPress Events organizers to share usable swag.
- Coordinate a donation of surplus swags that can’t be used again to a local charity.
