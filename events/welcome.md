# Sustainable Events Handbook

tl;dr: The journey toward a more sustainable world is long, but every action is a step forward. 

Each WordCamp event, whether in person or online, has an environmental impact—that's a given. However, opting for a sustainable alternative can make a positive impact.

You’ll find everything you need to know about organizing an event in the [WordCamp](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/), [Meetup](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/meetup-program-basics/), [Virtual](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/virtual-events/), or [WordPress Events](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/community-deputy/other-event-formats/nextgen-wordpress-event/) handbooks. The following suggestions will help ensure your event is more sustainable.

This handbook also includes some [tips for attendees](https://make.wordpress.org/sustainability/handbook/sustainable-events/attendees/), which you can feature on your event’s website.
